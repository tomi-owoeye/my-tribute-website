<p><h4>Truth lights the path to freedom! <br><br> "But the fruit produced by the Holy Spirit within you is divine love in all its varied expressions: joy that overflows, peace that subdues, patience that endures, kindess in action, a life full of virtue, faith that prevails, gentleness of heart, and strength of spirit. Never set the law above these qualities, for they are meant to be limitless!"<br>- Galatians 5:22-23 (The Passion Translation)</h4></p>
